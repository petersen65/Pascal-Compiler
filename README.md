# Pascal-Compiler
My Pascal Compiler that I wrote between 80's and 90's based on ETH ZÃ¼rich's Pascal S Compiler. The Compiler is very close to ANSI Pascal Standard and produces P-Code that can be executed with the Load program which is the needed runtime environment for compiled P-Code programs. 
The compiler itself was developed with Turbo Pascal. It detects by zero divisions and is able to fold constants. If anyone has Turbo Pascal 5.0 available on MS-DOS, I could compile the Pascal Compiler again and run test programs. Before my marriage in 2003 my last name was "Rippl". After 2003 my last name changed to "Petersen".

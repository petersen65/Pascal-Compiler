# Pascal-Compiler
My Pascal Compiler that I wrote between 80's and 90's based on ETH Zürich's Pascal S Compiler. The Compiler is very close to ANSI Pascal Standard and produces P-Code that can be executed with the Load program which is the needed runtime environment for compiled P-Code programs. The compiler itself was developed with Turbo Pascal.
